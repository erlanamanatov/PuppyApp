# Puppy Adoption App

![Workflow result](https://github.com/erlanamanatov/PuppyApp/workflows/Check/badge.svg)


## :scroll: Description
The Puppy adoption app contains 2 screens: an overview screen with all puppies and a detail screen showing each puppy's details.
UI was fully built in Compose


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
It is much easier and faster to build UI using Compose!
No more adapters and view holders for recycler views, xml files, etc. Everything is Koltin and it is great!
